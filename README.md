# Data Visualization using Power BI
These are study cases in my Coding and Big Data course that is requested us to analyze the data from an excel file and visualize it using Power BI so it can be understood easier. These study cases require us to visualize the data using a filled map, table, slicer, stacked bar chart, pie chart, and card tools in Power BI.

To view the data visualization on Power BI you may download and read the report that I have already attached.
